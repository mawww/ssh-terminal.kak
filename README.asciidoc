SSH :terminal
-------------

This script implement a `ssh-terminal` command suitable for the `terminal`
alias to be used when the terminal emulator should run on another machine.

The typical use case for this is working on a head less server:

--------------------------------------------
[user@client]$ ssh user@server
[user@server]$ kak # how to make :new work ?
--------------------------------------------

The solution is to ssh into client, run a new terminal emulator that ssh
back into server and runs the provided command.

This enables the local window manager to see different terminal emulators
for each remote clients, instead of having to use `tmux` or similar.

`ssh-terminal` does this using two options:

* *ssh_terminal_target* which is the username@host of the client
* *ssh_terminal_cmd* which is the command to run a terminal emulator there

For example:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
set-option global ssh_terminal_target user@client
set-option global ssh_terminal_cmd 'env WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 foot sh -c'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order for this to work connecting from `client` to `server` needs to be
password less, connecting from `server` to `client` can require a password
and will prompt in kakoune if necessary. It is recommended to use ssh control
master support to share the ssh connections and avoid having to enter passwords
